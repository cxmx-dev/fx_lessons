## 🎮 Available Lessons

### [🌟 Ambient Occlusion](/fx_lessons/ambient_occlusion/) - Your First Step into 3D Magic
**Perfect for beginners!** Start here to understand how light and shadows create depth and realism.

**What you'll discover:**
- **How shadows work** - Why objects look 3D instead of flat
- **Real-time lighting** - Create dynamic, changing environments
- **Interactive controls** - Move, rotate, and explore your 3D world
- **Particle effects** - Add life and movement to your scenes
- **Performance basics** - Make your creations run smoothly

**Why start here?** Ambient occlusion is the foundation of realistic 3D graphics. Once you understand this, you'll see the world differently - every shadow, every crevice, every surface will tell you a story about light and space.

## 🚀 Getting Started - Choose Your Adventure!

### 🎯 **Option 1: The Explorer's Path (Recommended for Beginners)**
Perfect if you want to dive in and start creating immediately!

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your first lesson
cd fx_lessons/ambient_occlusion/

# 2. Start the magic (this opens your browser automatically!)
live-server --port=5500 --entry-file=index.html

# 3. Your browser opens to http://localhost:5500
# 4. Start playing with the 3D scene!
```

**What happens next:** You'll see a beautiful 3D scene with a green geometric object, animated particles, and interactive controls. Use WASD to move, arrow keys to rotate, and mouse to orbit around your creation!

### 🐳 **Option 2: The Professional's Path (Docker)**
Great if you want to learn industry-standard deployment methods!

```bash
# 1. Build and run with Docker (feels like magic!)
docker-compose up --build

# 2. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080
# 3. Navigate to /fx_lessons/ambient_occlusion/
```

**Why Docker?** This is how real applications are deployed. Learning this now puts you ahead of the curve!

### 🎨 **Option 3: The Artist's Path (VS Code/Cursor)**

docker-compose up -d

# Stop everything
docker-compose down
```

## 🎨 Customization - Make It Yours!

### 🌈 **Changing Colors (Start Here!)**
```javascript
// Make the main object blue instead of green
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x0066ff });

// Change particles to purple
const particleMaterial = new THREE.PointsMaterial({ color: 0x9900ff });
```

### ⚡ **Adjusting Performance**
```javascript
// Reduce particles for better performance
const particleCount = 600; // Instead of 1200

// Increase for more dramatic effects
const particleCount = 2000; // For powerful computers
```

### 🎭 **Adding Your Own Objects**
```javascript
// Add a simple cube
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting - We've Got Your Back!

### 🖥️ **"I see a white screen!"**
1. **Check the console** (F12 → Console tab) for error messages
2. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Make sure the server is running** (you should see "Ready for changes" in terminal)
4. **Try a different browser** (Chrome works best)

### 🐌 **"It's running slowly!"**
1. **Reduce particle count** in the code
2. **Close other browser tabs**
3. **Check if your computer is running other heavy programs**
4. **Try the fallback scene** (it's simpler and faster)

### 🔗 **"Three.js won't load!"**
1. **Check your internet connection** (Three.js loads from CDN)
2. **Try refreshing the page**
3. **Use a modern browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. **Check if your firewall is blocking the connection**
